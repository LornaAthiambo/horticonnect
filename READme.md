HortiConnect is an innovative platform designed to connect horticultural farmers directly with customers, eliminating the need for middlemen. This allows farmers to sell their produce—such as vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs—directly to consumers, retailers, and wholesalers. By cutting out intermediaries, HortiConnect aims to ensure farmers receive fair prices for their products while providing customers with fresh, quality produce at more competitive rates.

The platform simplifies the process of buying and selling by offering a user-friendly marketplace where farmers can showcase their products, manage orders, and interact with buyers directly. Customers can easily browse and purchase horticultural products, ensuring transparency and building trust in the transaction process.

By bridging the gap between farmers and customers, HortiConnect promotes sustainability and efficiency in the supply chain, benefiting both the growers and the end consumers. It helps farmers improve their profit margins while giving buyers access to fresher, farm-sourced goods without inflated prices from middlemen.
